## Description

Ymir Engine is part of the Game Engines subject, on the third year of the Videogame Design and Development degree, taught at CITM UPC (Terrassa) and supervised by [Miquel Suau](https://github.com/MayKoder).

The engine has been made from scratch in C++ using SDL and OpenGL to manage graphics. The main target of the project is to be able to integrate complex systems such as graphics management and game engine architecture in a simple and understandable way for educational purposes.

During the development of Alien Extraction, the engine was also being improved adding more high level systems, in order to be able to develop all the features required by the game.

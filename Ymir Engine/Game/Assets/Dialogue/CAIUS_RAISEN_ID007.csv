1; Caius;Welcome back.;  ;<end>
2; Me;What happened?; ;<end>
3; Caius;Well, you died.;  ;<end>
4; Me;What do you mean?; ;<end>
5; Me;I look quite alive.; ;<end>
6; Caius;During your mission, something went wrong and we lost your constants. 
You had died, but don't worry, we can clone you and transfer your consciousness. 
You are basically the same person, in a new body. Do you feel renewed energy?;  ;<end>
7; Me;Not much; ;<end>
9; Caius;Don't worry, you will adapt to your new body slowly, you will probably 
feel like you are in a cryogenic state. If you don't feel up to it, you can stay 
on the ship for as long as you need to.;  ;<end>
10; Me;...; ;<end>
8; Me;Actually, I do.; ;<end>
11; Caius;I'm glad to hear that.;  ;<end>

1; Iscariot;Long time no see, Raisen.;  ;<end>
2; Me;Who are you?; ;<end>
6; Iscariot;Oh, that's right, your memory... They call me Iscariot, nice to see 
you again.;  ;<end>
7; Me;Memory?; ;<end>
5; Me;Yeah, bye.; ;<end>
10; Iscariot;That's right, when you passed the selection phase, your memory was 
re-formatted and re-wired to make you docile and obedient to the company. It 
seems to have worked, even after all these years.;  ;<end>
11; Me;Passed.; ;<end>
14; Iscariot;During your creation and development, a team of scientists, 
including myself, raised you and taught you what it takes to be who you are, 
taught you to fight, to adapt to your xenomorph side and making it compatible 
with your human side.;  ;<end>
15; Me;...; ;<end>
16; Iscariot;You are a consequence of an experiment. A sign of success. The hope 
of scientists who began to lose faith. You represent a step closer to immorality. 
The first to be eligible, subject 322, now just Raisen.; ;<end>
17; Me;...; ;<end>
18; Iscariot;You were born here, in this very laboratory, I raised you, and now 
you are destroying everything.; ;<end>
19; Me;This is no lab.; ;<end>
20; Iscariot;No, not now. After your release as a successful subject it became 
clear to me, xenomorphs can be better, David was right. I had to release them, 
it took me years to convince the rest, but I did it.; ;<end>
21; Me;David?; ;<end>
23; Iscariot;That's right, I met Android David on planet 4, I was a member of 
the USCSS Covenant and he wiped out the entire crew, convinced me of his purpose 
and that led me to this place. Xenomorphs are fascinating beings, they just need 
a little push to get to your level naturally, I am that push.; ;<end>
24; Me;...; ;<end>
25; Iscariot;You can help me, make this purpose real, the xenomorphs deserve to 
live. Like you... Like me... You can go against the corporation, you are better 
than them.; ;<end>
26; Me;I got a mission; ;<end>
27; Iscariot;The mission doesn't matter! You have a decision Raisen, if you kill 
the queen, all this, all my work is wasted. Will you kill the one who gave you 
birth? Yutani is acting as the hand of God, 
but we can kill God!; ;<end>
28; Me;I must do it; ;<end>
22; Me;Convince whom?; ;<end>
29; Iscariot;Androids, they were all here for the same purpose. Some in the 
warehouse moving heavy loads, others assisting in the computer section just above 
our heads, and the rest in this very place, researching mutations, behaviours, 
and biology.; ;<end>
30; Me;...; ;<end>
31; Iscariot;They're helpful, you know, like Caius. I'm sure you've come across 
what's left of some of them. I wasn't able to make them aware of the importance 
of our mission. How important we are to these creatures, and they never understood 
how intelligent they are.; ;<end>
32; Me;...; ;<end>
33; Iscariot;Unlike humans, the xenomorphs are able to adapt to us. You are 
seeing an example of this right now.; ;<end>
34; Me;Is that what David told you?; ;<end>
13; Me;I don't trust you, ciao.; ;<end>
8; Me;Why are you here?; ;<end>
35; Iscariot;Wait.; ;<end>
36; Me;Whom?; ;<end>
37; Iscariot;That's actually a very good question Raisen. Who the hell am I 
waiting for? Am I waiting for more humans to come back? Am I waiting to redeem 
myself for my companions? Am I waiting for you? Or the queen herself? Maybe you're 
the queen I've been waiting for.; ;<end>
38; Me;...; ;<end>
39; Iscariot;I don't know who I'm waiting for, a human trait I acquired during my 
work here, ignorance, and patience.; ;<end>
40; Me;Myself; ;<end>
42; Iscariot;I know you, yes, but I didn't expect you to come. At some point 
they'll send someone, this place is a mess, look how much dust! But to send you, 
that's cruel.; ;<end>
43; Me;What do you know?; ;<end>
44; Iscariot;Many things, Raisen. I raised you.
I know your background, your training, your exams, and your first mission. I know 
things you don't even remember anymore. You were born here, in this lab when it was 
still operational. Subject 322, a miracle born of an imperfect mutation.; ;<end>
45; Me;Mutation; ;<end>
46; Iscariot;Correct. All those xenomorphs you've been killing around here share 
DNA with you, although you may have already figured it out. In this laboratory 
we research the cure for life. In other words, we were in search of the perfect 
human, unable to grow old or get sick.; ;<end>
47; Me;...; ;<end>
48; Iscariot;Have you ever been sick, Raisen?
Anyway, the point is that your case is special, curious. You are the best result 
we have had in over a hundred years of mutations, and absolutely nobody knows 
the origin of your dna, you are the result of human error, fascinating.; ;<end>
49; Me;So...; ;<end>
50; Iscariot;Indeed.; ;<end>
41; Me;You're not a regular Android; ;<end>
51; Iscariot;I am not, at least not since my contact with David. He opened my eyes, my 
mind, made me more human.; ;<end>
52; Me;David; ;<end>
9; Me;My pleasure, bye.; ;<end>
3; Me;Do I know you?; ;<end>
4; Me;How...?; ;<end>
53; Iscariot;I know many things, Raisen.; ;<end>
54; Me;This place.; ;<end>
57; Iscariot;This is the hatchery, a lab founded and maintained by Weyland Yutani 
corp. with the aim of finding a perfect mutation to extend human life expectancy.; ;<end>
58; Me;Doesn't look like it.; ;<end>
59; Iscariot;That's right, my fault I guess. After some wrangling, I released all 
the xenomorphs and test subjects. Now it's closer to a nest than a laboratory. A 
considerable improvement, if you ask me.; ;<end>
60; Me;Wrangling?; ;<end>
61; Iscariot;For better or worse. I was seeking freedom for all living creatures, 
and the rest only their own. I guess nobody won anyway.; ;<end>
62; Me;The rest?; ;<end>
63; Me;Well...; ;<end>
64; Iscariot;Any other question?; ;<end>
65; Me;Who are you?; ;<end>
66; Me;Me; ;<end>
67; Me;I'd better go.; ;<end>
55; Me;Who are you?; ;<end>
68; Iscariot;Yes... that may merit further explanation; ;<end>
69; Me;I've got time.; ;<end>
70; Me;I've got no time for this.; ;<end>
56; Me;What happened?; ;<end>
72; Me;Doesn't look like it.; ;<end>
73; Iscariot;I am convinced. Although if it wasn't for that chip, maybe you wouldn't 
remember anything from your past lives, because tell me, how many times have you 
died here? Don't take this the wrong way, I just want you to know the truth.
I am convinced. ; ;<end>
71; Iscariot;That's right, I was seeking freedom for all living creatures, and the 
rest only their own. I guess nobody won anyway.; ;<end>
74; Me;There is no truth in you.; ;<end>

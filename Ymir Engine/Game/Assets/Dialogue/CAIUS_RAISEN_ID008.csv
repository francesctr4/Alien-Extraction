1; Caius;You found something.;  ;<end>
2; Me;The head.; ;<end>
3; Caius;Interesting.;  ;<end>
4; Me;What is?; ;<end>
5; Me;Is that all?; ;<end>
6; Caius;Oh, my apologies. This head is part of a synthetic. ASH model to be 
exact. It's a model that was discontinued quite some time ago, it was unreliable, 
but it didn't deserve this death.;  ;<end>
7; Me;Why did they use it here?; ;<end>
9; Caius;I don't know, Miss Raisen. But he was a very skilled model in scientific 
research, maybe that's why.;  ;<end>
10; Me;Can it be reactivated?; ;<end>
12; Caius;It's hard to say, we only have the essentials on this ship, and this 
head is completely shattered. I'm sorry I can't be of any help in this case.;  ;<end>
10; Me;It is all right.; ;<end>
8; Me;Deserve?; ;<end>
11; Caius;That's right, I have no capacity for affection or opinion, yet I can 
empathise with my equals.;  ;<end>
7; Me;Why did they use it here?; ;<end>

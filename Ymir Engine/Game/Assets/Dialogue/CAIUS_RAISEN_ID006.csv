1; Caius;Any news?;  ;<end>
2; Me;I found some data.; ;<end>
3; Caius;So mutations, yes, that fits with the mission.;  ;<end>
4; Me;With what exactly?; ;<end>
5; Caius;Well, this facility is dedicated to xenomorph research, I think you've 
already encountered some specimens. From what you show me, it looks like they 
were manipulating their DNA, and breeding 
the resulting creatures.;  ;<end>
6; Me;What for?; ;<end>
8; Caius;I can't know that, Miss Raisen. Maybe if you find something else I can 
help you find out. That data shouldn't be where you found it, I'm sure it's been
misplaced, it's likely you'll find 
more information.;  ;<end>
9; Me;Ask again.; ;<end>
10; Me;...; ;<end>
7; Me;Xenomorphs?; ;<end>
11; Yes, those creatures you are encountering, they are called Xenomorphs. Be 
careful, they adapt quickly, and won't make it easy for you. Well, that's 
something you have in common, though.;  ;<end>

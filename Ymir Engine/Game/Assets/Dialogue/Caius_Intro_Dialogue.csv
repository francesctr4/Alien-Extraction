1; Caius;Oh, good, I see they've woken you up. Just in time.;  ;<end>
2; Me;In time for what?; ;<end>
5; Caius;We've just arrived at Gliese 667. You'll have to clean up the planet. I 
don't have much information about the mission, it's labeled "Confidential 
level: EXTREME", I'm not allowed to access beyond the summary annex. I 
hope you have been briefed on better Raisen.;  ;<end>
6; Me;Clear your hopes Caius.;  ;<end>
7; Caius;I see... Don't worry ma'am, I'm sure you'll be able to resolve the situation 
without too much trouble. The teleport beacon is up ahead. Get them!; ; <end>
8; Me;I wish they did.;  ;<end>
9; Caius;The people at the top know your skills, surely they know what they are 
doing by not saying anything. If I could tell you more, you know I'm 
here to serve. Good luck Raisen. The teleport beacon is up ahead.; ;<end>
3; Me;Woken me up? What do you
mean?;  ;<end>
10; Caius;You have been cryopreserved for the journey, about 40 years deep 
sleeping. But don't worry, we're already at Gliese 667,our final 
destination. Now it's your turn to continue the mission.; ;<end>
11; Me;Mission?; ;<end>
12; Caius;Indeed, the mission. The files are classified with a very high confidentiality
value, I cannot access the full information, but according to the brief, you 
have to clear the planet, wipe out any sign of life, hostile or not. I can 
imagine that won't be much of a problem.; ;<end>
13; Me;I guess I'll have to get down 
to work.; ;<end>
14; Caius;Of course. Just follow the corridor, you will find a teleportation beacon. 
Good luck.;  ;<end>
15; Me;When do we start?;  ;<end>
16; Caius;Right away. Just continue to the next room, you will find a teleportation 
beacon.;  ;<end>
17; Me;Anyone would say it was more, 
don't you think?; ;<end>
18; Caius;It is normal to feel very nauseous and dizzy when waking up after a long 
time under the effects of cryogenics. So, yes, I'm sure it's only been 40 
years, if you need more time to adjust, you can give the ship a spin, in 
a few minutes you should feel better.;  ;<end>
19; Me;I'm fine Caius.; ;<end>
20; Caius;Perfect! I'm glad to hear that. Then you won't have any problems getting 
started with the mission. Just go to the teleport beacon, it will send 
you directly to the planet.;  ;<end>
21; Me;I was... Ugh. Just tell me about 
the mission.; ;<end>
22; Caius;There is not much to tell, I have limited access due to mission. But I can 
tell you that it has to eradicate the life of Gliese 667. Iassumed you would 
know more about it, but I see I was wrong. If you want to godown and 
investigate, go to the next room, you'll find the teleport beacon, it will
takeyou straight to the planet.;  ;<end>
23; Me;When do we start?; ;<end>
24; Caius;Right away. Just continue to the next room, you will find a 
teleportation beacon.?; ;<end>
25; Me;Up and ready for the mission.; ;<end>
26; Caius;I'm glad to hear that. Then you won't have any problems getting started
with the mission. Just go to the teleport beacon, it will send you directly
to the planet.;  ;<end>
4; Me;Up and ready for the mission.;  ;<end>

1; Caius;You've got questions.;  ;<end>
2; Me;Empress; ;<end>
3; Caius;The empresses are a subspecies within the Xenomorph family. It's a queen, 
it's quite rare, they were last seen on Phobos, a moon not far from here. 
Have you found any?;  ;<end>
4; Me;I've seen no Queen.; ;<end>
5; Caius;The main role of an empress is to layer eggs, but they are aggressive, 
and defend the hive. If you come across one, be careful, you are likely to 
encounter a mutation of the one I know.; ;<end>
6; Me;How to distinguish.; ;<end>
7; Caius;It should be simple, they can be several metres tall, even up to a dozen. 
They usually have a very deep, dark colour and camouflage perfectly with the 
material of the hive, but again, with this series of experiments nothing is certain, 
although I have a feeling you'll know it when you see it.; ;<end>
8; Me;Thanks.; ;<end>
9; Me;A feeling?; ;<end>
10; Caius;Sharp, very sharp. Good luck Raisen.; ;<end>
11; Me;...; ;<end>
